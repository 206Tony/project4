Project Planning
In this phase I started planning with my database models. I did research on the API that I used because of the importance of my database route planning depended on the data received back from the API. After finding an API that I was interested in, I built the necessary models. The models were simple because I only had one relation from my parent model (users) to our child model (set). I then moved on to wireframing for our site. This would determine what components I would need and how I would build essential structure for my site. After I was able to work through these items, I then went on to coding.

Project Coding
During this phase I started building the routes and a skeleton structure of our site. I was able to get routes working fairly quickly. We tested the routes by using Postman. The bare bones skeleton of the website was set and then we moved on to the logic of our website. While working on this part of the project we had some slight hiccups with getting data to render but after some troubleshooting, we were able to get our data sending. Getting data to render from our own API was rather simple but saving data to our database provided some great learning opportunities. After we were able to overcome this slight hurdle, we worked on getting our code to become more dynamic to render individual drinks and user information. We then worked on styling to make sure that everything was presentable.
